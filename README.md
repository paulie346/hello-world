# hello-world
My first repository...and probably my last

Hi Everyone,

I am a Technical Recruiter at Vevo. I created a GitHub Account because I wanted to be cool like you engineers. I am doing this because I want that sweet, sweet green square :)

If you have any desire to join us at Vevo and help as we continue to scale at an amazing rate, send me an email at paul.mckenzie@vevo.com

Thanks!
